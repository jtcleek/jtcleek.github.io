Hello! I'm Joshua, operating out of the Kansas City metro.

By day, I work as an **Application Delivery Engineer** in the healthcare industry, with a strong focus on **UNIX systems**. I also contribue to **DevOps** and **automation** initiatives across my team.

By night, I'm a husband, father, and lifelong tech enthusiast. I enjoy traveling with my family, trying new beers, and spinning up services in my ever-evolving **homelab**.
