+++

If you spend any time in tech circles or online writing communities, you’ll eventually stumble across posts about why you should start a blog. They all make good points: it helps solidify your learning, build a portfolio, share knowledge, and so on.

But just as common is the counterpoint, “No one is going to read your blog.”

And honestly? Both are probably true.

I’m not writing this to chase traffic, followers, or fame. I’m doing it simply because I enjoy tech, whether I’m exploring something new, tinkering with a setup, or sharing what I discover. It’s a way to reflect, to clarify my thoughts, and maybe even create something that helps someone else out of a jam someday, whether it's next week or five years from now.

This blog isn’t a polished tutorial site. It’s more like a public notebook. Some posts might be half-baked ideas, others might just be breadcrumbs to remember how I solved a frustrating issue. And that’s okay.

If you're reading this, welcome. And if you're considering starting a blog yourself—do it. Not because someone told you to, but because it might matter to you later.
